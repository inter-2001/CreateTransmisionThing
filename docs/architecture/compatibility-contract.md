# Compatibility Contract

The following values are externally consumed and must remain stable across internal refactors.

## Registry identifiers

- Block / item: `aeronautics_utility_objects:brass_universal_joint` (the Universal Joint Head)
- Items: `aeronautics_utility_objects:universal_joint_rod` (brass rod), `aeronautics_utility_objects:universal_joint_rod2` (andesite rod)
- Block entity: `aeronautics_utility_objects:universal_joint`

`create_aeronautics_toolgun` identifies these block entities by registry id when saving and placing blueprints.

The legacy `aeronautics_utility_objects:universal_joint` block, the pneumatic/hydraulic blocks and items, and the
kinetic conversion bearing were removed. Worlds that contain them will report them as missing.

## Persistent link format

Linked universal joints persist their partner through these NBT keys:

- `LinkedPos`: partner position, encoded as a normal NBT block position.
- `LinkedSubLevel`: optional partner sub-level UUID.

The keys and their coordinate meaning are part of the blueprint compatibility contract. Internal state may be
reorganized, but a loaded legacy tag must retain the same effective link.

## Config

Settings live in the common config file `config/aeronautics_utility_objects-common.toml`, shared by every world.
`universal_joint.stress_impact` is registered with Create's `BlockStressValues.IMPACTS` for the joint head.

## Network and player-facing identifiers

Keep the existing translation keys, item ids, and block ids. Changes to implementation
packages are allowed when public entry points and serialized data remain compatible.
